There is one word every day, which is the same for everyone. The new puzzle is released every day at midnight. Each time you guess a word, the letters will turn green, yellow or grey to indicate if it is in the correct spot. Green means the letter is in the right position, yellow means the letter appears somewhere in the word but not in the current position, and grey means the letter isn’t in the word at all.Letter analysisWordle will ever use are apparently all served to your device whenever you visit the webpage. The game only shows you the word for the current day however.So, I decided to loop through all 2000+ words and plot the most frequently used letters. I used Python (specifically numpy and matplotlib + seaborn) to make the plot in a jupyter notebook which you can find in the GitHub repo linked below.GitHub: https://github.com/amir-yusoff/wordle-letter-distributionWord/Answer key: https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/main.e65ce0a5.jsTop 10 Letters UsedTipsIRONS and CLEAT are good words to start off the game with." }, { "title": "Deploy Clouflare DDNS on Docker", "url": "/posts/Deploy-Clouflare-DDNS-on-Docker/", "categories": "Tutorial, Server, Docker", "tags": "", "date": "2022-01-12 19:00:00 +0800", "snippet": "Docker Compose to install Cloudflare Dynamic Dns on your serverversion: &#39;2&#39;services: cloudflare-ddns: image: oznu/cloudflare-ddns:latest restart: always environment: - API_KEY=************************** - ZONE=example.com - PROXIED=true - PUID=1000 - PGID=100" }, { "title": "How to run Chirpy theme in Jekyll web server on macOS", "url": "/posts/How-to-run-Jekyll-web-server-on-macOS/", "categories": "Website, Tutorial, Server", "tags": "", "date": "2022-01-11 21:55:00 +0800", "snippet": "PrerequisitesThis tutorial is to install and run the Chirpy theme in Jekyll web server for development.
